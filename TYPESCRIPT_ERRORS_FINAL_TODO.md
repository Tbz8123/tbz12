# TypeScript Errors Resolution - Final TODO List

## Overview
This document outlines the remaining TypeScript errors that need to be resolved in the TBZ Resume Builder V4 project.

## Priority 1: Critical Type Errors

### 1. Authentication Context Issues
- [ ] Fix `isAdmin` property missing in `ExtendedUser` interface in `client-admin/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- [ ] Update `tier` to `currentTier` in auth-related files to match Prisma schema
- [ ] Ensure proper type definitions for Firebase auth integration

### 2. Resume Store and Context
- [ ] Fix `ResumeState` interface to include missing `resume` and `updateResume` properties
- [ ] Resolve type mismatches in `ResumeContext` between expected and actual types
- [ ] Update `activeProTemplateId` type from `string | null` to `number | null`

### 3. Schema and Data Structure Issues
- [ ] Add missing `id` properties to `Education` and `Experience` objects
- [ ] Fix `CustomSection` interface to remove invalid `placement` property
- [ ] Add missing `previewImageUrl` to `ResumeTemplateRecord` interface
- [ ] Ensure `Certification` interface has required `id` property

## Priority 2: Component Type Issues

### 4. UI Components
- [ ] Fix breadcrumb component type issues
- [ ] Resolve sidebar component type mismatches
- [ ] Update component prop types to match actual usage

### 5. Sample Data Generation
- [ ] Add `id` fields to all sample data objects (education, experience, certifications)
- [ ] Remove invalid `placement` property from custom sections
- [ ] Ensure sample data matches schema interfaces

## Priority 3: Import and Module Issues

### 6. Missing Modules
- [ ] Create missing `prisma.ts` files in both client and client-admin lib directories
- [ ] Fix Next.js import issues by replacing with custom interfaces
- [ ] Resolve any remaining module resolution errors

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with Schema Fixes**: Update shared schema to ensure all interfaces are properly defined
2. **Fix Sample Data**: Update sample data generators to include all required fields
3. **Update Components**: Fix component implementations to use correct types
4. **Test Build**: Run TypeScript check and build to verify all errors are resolved
5. **Launch Application**: Start development server and verify functionality

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` passes without errors
- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] Development server starts without TypeScript errors
- [ ] All components render correctly without type-related runtime errors

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Priority 1 items
2. Test after each major fix
3. Move to Priority 2 and 3 items
4. Final verification and testing
