### Admin UI Rendering Issue Investigation

**Objective:** Resolve the issue where the admin page UI is not rendering correctly after being separated from the main frontend application.

**To-Do List:**

1.  **Analyze `client-admin` Configuration (`vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`)**
    - [ ] Review `vite.config.ts` for any incorrect paths, proxy settings, or build configurations.
    - [ ] Inspect `tailwind.config.ts` to ensure it's correctly configured for the `client-admin` project and that styles are being applied properly.

2.  **Inspect Application Entry Point and Routing (`App.tsx`, `src/pages`)**
    - [ ] Examine `client-admin/src/App.tsx` to understand the main component structure and routing setup.
    - [ ] Review the files in `client-admin/src/pages` to verify that the admin page route is correctly defined and that the component is being rendered.

3.  **Review Component-Level Styling (`AdminProPage.tsx`)**
    - [ ] Investigate `AdminProPage.tsx` for any component-specific styling that might be causing layout issues.
    - [ ] Check for hardcoded values or conflicting CSS classes that could interfere with rendering.

4.  **Examine `index.css` for Global Style Conflicts**
    - [ ] Review `client-admin/src/index.css` for any global styles that might be overriding component-level styles or causing unexpected layout behavior.

5.  **Verify Backend Communication and Check for Errors**
    - [ ] Open the browser's developer tools and check the console for any new JavaScript errors that could be preventing the UI from rendering.
    - [ ] Check the network tab to ensure that all necessary API requests are being made successfully and that there are no CORS or other network-related issues.

6.  **Implement and Verify Fix**
    - [ ] Based on the findings, implement the necessary code changes to fix the rendering issue.
    - [ ] Restart the development server and verify that the admin page now renders correctly.
