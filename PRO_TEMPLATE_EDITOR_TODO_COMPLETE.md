- The route was missing from the App.tsx routing configuration

  ```

### Status: âœ… RESOLVED

## âœ… Task 2: Verify Save Functionality

### Confirmation
- User confirmed that save functionality is working correctly on `/admin/templates/pro-editor`
- Complete save flow documented and verified:

### Save Flow Architecture
1. **Frontend Component** (`ProTemplateEditor.tsx`)
   - Form validation (name and code required)
   - Data preparation with all template fields
   - POST request to `/api/pro-templates`
   - Success/error handling with toast notifications
   - Redirect to management page after successful save

2. **Backend API Route** (`server/routes.ts`)
   - POST `/api/pro-templates` endpoint
   - Zod schema validation
   - Data processing and storage layer call
   - Proper error handling and response

3. **Database Layer** (`server/storage.ts`)
   - `createProTemplate()` method
   - Prisma ORM integration
   - Fallback to Template model if ProTemplate unavailable
   - Complete field mapping and data persistence

### Key Features Verified
- âœ… Form validation (name and code required)
- âœ… Enhanced 3D thumbnail support
- âœ… Multiple display modes (thumbnail/uploaded_image)
- âœ… Thumbnail type selection (standard/enhanced3d)
- âœ… Metadata handling for enhanced 3D thumbnails
- âœ… Success notifications and user feedback
- âœ… Query invalidation for data consistency
- âœ… Automatic redirect after successful save
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling

### Status: âœ… VERIFIED AND WORKING
