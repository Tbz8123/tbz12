# Build Issue Comprehensive TODO

## Current Status
- ✅ Updated package.json with correct npm --prefix commands
- ✅ Verified client/package.json has correct build script
- ✅ Direct npm --prefix command works successfully
- ✅ npm run build:client now works after npm cache clear
- ✅ npm run build:admin works correctly
- ✅ Full npm run build completes successfully

## Problem Analysis
The package.json file shows the correct content:
```json
"build:client": "npm --prefix client run build",
"build:admin": "npm --prefix client-admin run build",
```

However, when running `npm run build:client`, it still executes:
```
vite build --config client/vite.config.ts
```

This indicates a persistent npm caching issue.

## Solutions to Try

### 1. Force npm to reload package.json ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
- [x] Run npm install
- [x] Test build commands

### 2. Alternative script approach
- [ ] Use PowerShell-compatible commands in package.json
- [ ] Test with cd client; npm run build format

### 3. Workspace verification
- [ ] Verify we're editing the correct package.json file
- [ ] Check for multiple package.json files
- [ ] Ensure file permissions allow writing

### 4. Manual build process
- [ ] Document working manual build steps
- [ ] Create build script files as backup

## Working Commands (Verified)
```bash
# These work correctly:
npm --prefix client run build
npm --prefix client-admin run build

# These fail due to caching:
npm run build:client
npm run build:admin
npm run build
```

## Next Steps
1. Try deleting node_modules and reinstalling
2. If that fails, create alternative build scripts
3. Document the working manual process
