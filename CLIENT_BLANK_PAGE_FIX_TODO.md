# TODO: Fix Blank Page Issue in Client Application

1.  **[ ] Inspect `client/src/main.tsx` and `client/src/App.tsx`:** Understand the application's entry point and root component structure.
2.  **[ ] Check for Console Errors:** Run `npm run dev:client` and carefully examine the browser's developer console for any errors.
3.  **[ ] Review `client/vite.config.ts`:** Check for any misconfigurations, especially proxy settings.
4.  **[ ] Compare with `client-admin` Configuration:** Compare `tailwind.config.ts` and other relevant configuration files between the `client` and `client-admin` applications to identify discrepancies.
5.  **[ ] Check `index.html`:** Ensure the root element is present and correctly referenced.
