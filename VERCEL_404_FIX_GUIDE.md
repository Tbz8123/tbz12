# Vercel 404 Error Fix Guide

## Problem Analysis

Your Vercel deployment is showing a 404 NOT_FOUND error because the `vercel.json` configuration was incorrectly set up for static file serving.

### Issues Found:

1. **Incorrect Build Configuration**: The original config used `@vercel/static` with wrong `distDir` paths
2. **Missing Static File Builds**: Vercel wasn't properly building and serving the client and admin static files
3. **Route Order Issues**: Admin assets route was placed after the catch-all admin route

## Solution Applied

### Updated `vercel.json` Configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": "dist/client/**",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    },
    {
      "src": "dist/admin/**",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "server/index.ts"
    },
    {
      "src": "/admin/assets/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/admin/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/admin/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/admin/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/assets/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/client/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/client/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  },
  "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build"
}
```

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added Static File Builds**: 
   - `dist/client/**` with `@vercel/static`
   - `dist/admin/**` with `@vercel/static`

2. **Fixed Route Order**: 
   - Admin assets route comes before admin catch-all route
   - Ensures proper asset serving

3. **Removed Incorrect Configuration**: 
   - Removed wrong `distDir` configurations
   - Removed `outputDirectory` that was conflicting

4. **Fixed Server Static File Serving**: 
   - Updated `server/vite.ts` to serve from correct `dist/client` and `dist/admin` paths
   - Added proper admin route handling
   - Fixed fallback routes for both client and admin apps

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Redeployment
1. Commit the updated `vercel.json` to your repository
2. Push to your main branch
3. Vercel will automatically redeploy

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. Select "Use existing Build Cache: No"

### Option 3: CLI Redeploy
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

## Build Process Verification

The build process should create:
```
dist/
├── client/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── assets/
│   └── ...
├── admin/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── assets/
│   └── ...
└── index.js (server)
```

### Files Modified:
- `vercel.json` - Fixed Vercel deployment configuration
- `server/vite.ts` - Fixed static file serving paths

## Expected URLs After Fix

- **Main App**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/`
- **Admin Panel**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/admin/`
- **API Endpoints**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/*`

## Troubleshooting

If you still see 404 errors after redeployment:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Ensure all three builds (client, admin, server) complete successfully
2. **Verify File Structure**: Check that `dist/` folder contains both `client/` and `admin/` directories
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh or use incognito mode
4. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set in Vercel dashboard

## Environment Variables to Set in Vercel

Make sure these are configured in your Vercel project settings:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (if using)
- `FIREBASE_*` variables
- Any other environment variables your app requires

---

**Status**: ✅ Configuration Updated - Ready for Redeployment

After redeployment, your app should load correctly without 404 errors.
