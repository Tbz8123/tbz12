# React Query Dependency Fix TODO

## Current Issue
- **Problem**: @tanstack/react-query package resolution error in the client application
- **Error Message**: "Failed to resolve entry for package '@tanstack/react-query'. The package may have incorrect main/module/exports specified in its package.json."
- **Impact**: Client development server fails to start properly, causing preview errors

## Root Cause Analysis
- The @tanstack/react-query version 5.76.1 appears to have compatibility issues
- Package resolution is failing during Vite's pre-transform process
- This is preventing the client application from loading correctly

## Completed Steps
✅ Identified the specific error in the development server logs
✅ Located @tanstack/react-query version 5.76.1 in package.json
✅ Attempted clean reinstall of dependencies (removed node_modules and package-lock.json)
✅ Regenerated Prisma client
✅ Downgraded @tanstack/react-query to version 5.75.0 - Issue persisted
✅ Downgraded @tanstack/react-query to version 5.74.0 - Issue persisted
✅ Downgraded @tanstack/react-query to version 4.36.1 - Issue persisted
✅ Verified QueryClient configuration is compatible with v4

## TODO List

### Phase 1: Dependency Resolution
- [ ] **Downgrade @tanstack/react-query to a stable version**
  - Try version 5.75.x or 5.74.x
  - Update package.json with compatible version
  - Test if the issue persists

- [ ] **Alternative: Try @tanstack/react-query v4**
  - If v5 continues to have issues, downgrade to v4.x
  - Update any breaking changes in the codebase
  - Ensure compatibility with existing React Query usage

### Phase 2: Verification
- [ ] **Test client application startup**
  - Run `npm run dev` successfully
  - Verify no package resolution errors
  - Confirm server starts on http://localhost:5000

- [ ] **Test application functionality**
  - Open preview in browser
  - Verify no console errors
  - Test basic navigation and features

### Phase 3: Documentation
- [ ] **Update this TODO with resolution**
  - Document the working version
  - Note any code changes required
  - Mark tasks as complete

## Notes
- The main client application was working before the dependency issue
- Admin routes have been successfully removed from client/src/App.tsx
- The authentication redirect issue has been resolved
- This dependency issue is preventing proper testing of the fix
- **IMPORTANT**: The issue may not be specifically with @tanstack/react-query
- Terminal output is not displaying properly, making debugging difficult
- Multiple version downgrades did not resolve the server startup issue

## Current Status
- **Issue Persists**: Development server fails to start despite multiple attempts
- **Versions Tested**: 5.76.1 (original), 5.75.0, 5.74.0, 4.36.1
- **Connection Status**: ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED on http://localhost:5000
- **Root Cause**: May be deeper than just React Query dependency

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Investigate other potential causes**:
   - Check for Node.js version compatibility issues
   - Verify Vite configuration
   - Check for conflicting dependencies
   - Review server startup scripts

2. **Alternative debugging approaches**:
   - Try running with verbose logging
   - Check system resources and port conflicts
   - Test with minimal dependency set

3. **Fallback solution**:
   - Revert to original @tanstack/react-query version 5.76.1
   - Focus on resolving the actual server startup issue
   - The original preview was working despite the React Query errors
