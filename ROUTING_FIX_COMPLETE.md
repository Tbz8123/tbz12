# Routing Fix - TODO List ✅ COMPLETED

## ✅ Task: Fix `/admin/templates/pro-editor` 404 Error

### Problem
- User reported that `/admin/templates/pro-editor` page was showing a 404 "Page Not Found" error
- The route was missing from the App.tsx routing configuration

### Root Cause Analysis
- Checked App.tsx routing configuration
- Found that ProTemplateEditor component was only mapped to `/admin/pro/templates/new`
- The route `/admin/templates/pro-editor` was completely missing

### Solution Applied
- Added missing route in `client/src/App.tsx`:
  ```javascript
  <Route path="/admin/templates/pro-editor" component={ProTemplateEditor} />
  ```
- This route now points to the same ProTemplateEditor component as `/admin/pro/templates/new`

### Files Modified
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Added the missing route configuration

### Testing Results
- ✅ `/admin/templates/pro-editor` now loads successfully
- ✅ ProTemplateEditor component renders properly
- ✅ No functional errors (only harmless Google Analytics network errors)
- ✅ Page displays the template editor interface correctly

### Status: RESOLVED ✅

The routing issue has been completely fixed. Users can now access the Pro Template Editor at `/admin/templates/pro-editor` without encountering a 404 error.

---

## Summary
Successfully resolved the 404 routing issue by adding the missing route configuration. The Pro Template Editor is now accessible via both:
- `/admin/pro/templates/new` (existing route)
- `/admin/templates/pro-editor` (newly added route)

Both routes point to the same ProTemplateEditor component, providing flexibility in navigation paths.
