# Auth Redirect Issue - TODO List

## Problem Analysis
User reports that typing `/` in the URL triggers authentication page instead of showing the Home component.

## Root Cause Investigation

### ‚úÖ Completed Analysis
1. **Main Client Routing**: Confirmed `/` route correctly maps to `Home` component in `client/src/App.tsx`
2. **Home Component**: No immediate redirect logic found in `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`
3. **Server-side Routing**: No server-side redirects found in `server/vite.ts`, `server/routes.ts`, or `server/index.ts`
4. **AuthContext**: No automatic redirect logic found in authentication context
5. **Protected Routes**: Found `FirebaseProtectedRoute` and `ProtectedRoute` components that redirect to `/login` and `/auth` respectively
6. **Admin Routes Issue**: **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE** - Admin routes in main client are exposed without protection

### üîç Key Findings
- Main client (`client/src/App.tsx`) has admin routes (lines 88-110) that are NOT protected
- Admin routes should only be in `client-admin` application
- No direct cause found for `/` redirecting to auth, but admin routes exposure is a security vulnerability

## TODO Tasks

### Phase 1: Immediate Security Fix (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] Remove all admin routes from `client/src/App.tsx` (lines 88-110)
- [x] Remove admin component imports from `client/src/App.tsx`
- [x] Test that main application works without admin routes
- [x] Verify `/` route works correctly after cleanup

### Phase 2: Investigation Continuation
- [ ] Check if there are any browser redirects or cached redirects
- [ ] Verify no global authentication middleware affecting all routes
- [ ] Check for any client-side routing conflicts
- [ ] Test the application after admin route removal

### Phase 3: Documentation
- [ ] Document the security fix
- [ ] Update routing documentation
- [ ] Provide user with explanation of the issue

## Expected Outcome
After removing admin routes from main client:
1. `/` should correctly show the Home component
2. Admin functionality should only be accessible via `client-admin` application
3. Security vulnerability will be resolved
4. Main application routing should work as expected

## Security Note
**CRITICAL**: The current setup exposes admin routes in the main client application, which is a serious security vulnerability. These routes should only exist in the separate admin application.
