# Deployment Issue - Raw JavaScript Display TODO List

## Problem Analysis
The Vercel deployment completed successfully (as shown in logs), but the browser is displaying raw JavaScript code instead of the rendered React application. This indicates a routing or configuration issue.

## Root Cause Investigation
- ✅ Build completed successfully for all components (client, admin, server)
- ✅ All assets were generated and bundled correctly
- ❌ Browser serving raw JavaScript instead of HTML
- ❌ Likely routing configuration issue

## TODO List

### 1. Check Current Vercel Configuration
- [ ] Examine current `vercel.json` configuration
- [ ] Verify routing rules and rewrites
- [ ] Check if SPA (Single Page Application) routing is properly configured

### 2. Verify Build Output Structure
- [ ] Check if `index.html` is in the correct location
- [ ] Verify static file serving configuration
- [ ] Ensure proper file paths in build output

### 3. Fix Routing Configuration
- [ ] Add proper SPA routing rules to `vercel.json`
- [ ] Configure fallback to `index.html` for client-side routing
- [ ] Set up proper static file serving

### 4. Test and Validate
- [ ] Deploy updated configuration
- [ ] Test application loading in browser
- [ ] Verify all routes work correctly
- [ ] Check both client and admin interfaces

## Expected Solution
The issue is likely that Vercel needs explicit routing configuration to serve the React SPA properly. We need to add rewrite rules to ensure all routes fallback to the appropriate `index.html` files.

## Priority: HIGH
This is blocking the application from being usable in production.
